# ðŸ§  Image Classification with Keras

This project is a standard image classification model built using TensorFlow/Keras. It classifies input images into one of 10 categories:

**`['Plane', 'Car', 'Bird', 'Cat', 'Deer', 'Dog', 'Frog', 'Horse', 'Ship', 'Truck']`**

## ðŸ–¼ What It Does

- Trains an image classification model using deep learning
- Predicts the class of new images provided by the user
- Supports image input from the `test_images/` folder
- Saves the trained model as `image_classifier.keras`
- Also includes a Jupyter Notebook version: `image-classification.ipynb`

All code is in `main.py`, with optional exploration and training in the notebook.

## ðŸ›  How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexmueller07/image-classification.git
   cd image-classification
